    Lipstick is widely known as one of the most popular lip products. They come in a variety of styles. Satin, glossy,
    matte, and more. Lipstick is compact, and easy to use. It comes in a small tube, and can last for quite a while.
    These also come in a variety of colours, however red is one of the most iconic colours of lipstick.

  <h2>Lipbalm</h2>

        src="images/lipbalm.jpeg" width="200" height="200" alt="Lipbalm"> </a>
    Though not marketed as a makeup item, in modern day makeup it is widely used in makeup. Some come in many shades and
    variety, and can even replace other lip products. These are often much more moisturizing while still providing
    colour to the lips.

  <h2>Lip gloss</h2>

    Also another favourite by the makeup community, lip gloss can go on top of lipstick or other products, or can be
    applied by itself. These are used to give your lips a shiny, glossy juicy look. These can be very pigmented, or can
    be very sheer and clear so you can layer it.
  </p>

  <h2>Lip tint/stain</h2>
  <p class=lip>
    <a
      href="https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/fenty-poutsicle-hydrating-lip-stain-P500061?skuId=2563542&icid2=products%20grid:p500061:product"><img
        src="images/liptint.jpg" width="250" height="200" alt="Lip Tint"> </a>
    Lip tints or stains are some of the longer lasting lip products. As the names suggests, it tints or stains the lips
    so that the colour stays for a longer period of time. Often these are used, then lip gloss tops the stain off. If
    you want a reliable, long lasting colour on your lips, this is the go to product.
  </p>

  <h2>Lip liner</h2>
  <p class=lip>
    <a
      href="https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/lip-pencil-P77785456?skuId=2092658&icid2=products%20grid:p77785456:product"><img
        src="images/lipliner.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Lip Liner"> </a>
    As the name suggests, this lip liner is used to line the outside of your lips. Many people use this to get a nice
    sharp edge to their lips. Lip liners usually need to go with another product or else the harshness of the line may
    look weird. People often use clear gloss to blend out the line, or layer lipstick ontop.
  </p>

  <h2>Lip oil</h2>
  <p class=lip>
    <a
      href="https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/rare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-soft-pinch-tinted-lip-oil-P505568?skuId=2640159&icid2=products%20grid:p505568:product"><img
        src="images/lipoil.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Lip Oil"> </a>
    Lip oils are similar to lip glosses in the way they provide a nice glossy shine to your lips. However lip oils are
    targeted towards moisturizing your lips a lot more than your traditional lip gloss. These provide both moisture and
    colour to your lips.
  </p>

  <h2>Lip plumper</h2>
  <p class=lip>
    <a
      href="https://www.sephora.com/ca/en/product/too-faced-plump-prime-face-plumping-primer-serum-P467794?skuId=2410942&icid2=products%20grid:p467794:product"><img
        src="images/lipplumper.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Lip Plumper"> </a>
    Lip plumper is a very experimental product. These are often lip glosses, infused with ingredients that will tingle
    your lips. Some formulas may even make your lips feel like they're burning, however this is usually temporary. These
    glosses make your lips much larger as your lip reacts to the burn and turns redder and enlargens.
