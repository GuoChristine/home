  <h2> What is Makeup?</h2>
  <p>
    Now what is makeup? In modern day, makeup is a broad name for the group of products that many people generally use
    on their face to enhance their features, create art, and express themselves. The usage of makeup is very popular
    amongst both women and men. Makeup dates back to 6000 BCE, where both female and male Egyptians would wear makeup.
    They believed it appealed to gods. Over time, this tradition of wearing makeup evolved over many different cultures,
    all until now. Where it is still commonly used for cultural reasons, or entertainment or for everyday wear. Here,
    you will find a variety of makeup products that are widely used.
