    Eyebrow gel is used to style your eyebrows and keep them in place all day. With this, you can make your eyebrows
    much neater with a single stroke of this. The gel often solidifies after a while so that no wind, water or outside
    factors can move your neatly styled eyebrows.

  <h2>Additional Info</h2>
  <p class=larger>
    Now that you've begun makeup, know that there are many factors that come with makeup. Often times the prices are
    quite expensive. Even at local drugstores, prices can range up to 50 dollars. Do be aware that more expensive does
    not mean better quality. There are many ways you can find cheaper products by looking online. If you really want to
    splurge on an expensive item, its better to go research about the item, look at reviews, and/or find a dupe for that
    item. Sometimes the dupe performs better than the actual product. Another tip is to moisturize and have a skincare
    routine. Prioritize this as moisturize, acne free skin is a better surface to work on and will allow even better
    application of products.
